              <h1>Language</h1>
              <p>
                Here, it is described generally how the language functions internally, referencing
                the internal structure of objects, inheritance and function-calling. 
              </p>
              <h2>Objects</h2>
              <p>
                All values in hydra are objects. An object in hydra consists of several parts:
                <ol>
                  <li> <b>Slots:</b>
                    The most important part of an object is it's slots, which are sometimes referred to as fields in other Object
                    Oriented languages. A slot can be thought of as a (name, value) pair, which relates names - represented internally 
                    as objects called <i>symbols</i> to values (i.e. other objects). There is a third part of a slot which is optional,
                    called a <i>contract</i>, which is part of inheritance in Hydra (more on this later). 
                  <li> <b>Meta:</b>
                    Objects also have a distinct set of slots called metadata-slots, which store (as the name implies) metadata. This information
                    is harder to access and modify, and includes information that is useful to either the programmer (e.g. documentation) or
                    the interpreter (e.g. debug information). 
                  </li>
                  <li> <b>Contract:</b>
                    Hydra is prototype-based, which means that objects can also play the role of /classes/ in other languages, forming the basis
                    of inheritance hierarchies. A <i>contract</i> allows for more complex, <i>parametric</i> inheritance. 
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <h2>Function Invocation</h2>
              <p>
                A function invocation looks like <code>(function arg-1 arg-2 arg-3)</code> when this happens, two operations need to be performed:
                <ol>
                  <li>A mapping needs to be established between input values and symbols. Usually this is based on input, but may also include, e.g. keywords</li>
                  <li>The /body/ of the expression must be evaluated, with this mapping</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
