            Hydra is an experimental interpreted language which
            explores the intersection of several design concepts: it has a prototype based object-system
            inspired by the <a href="https://selflanguage.org/">self language</a>, but
            with a multiple dispatch system inspired by
            <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html">CLOS</a>.
            When combined with lispy syntax and macros, this leads to interesting metaprogramming
            and self-modification opportunities.

            I have written a small <a href="https://github.com/rationalis-petra/hydra/wiki">wiki</a>
            on github, which is generally up-to date, although there are occasional discrepencies
            between how something is described vs how it actually behaves.

          <h3>Windows</h3>
          <p>
            Hydra has no installer, but you can grab the raw binary <a href="bin/hydra.exe">here</a>
            or follow the build instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/rationalis-petra/hydra">github page</a>.
            You'll need conan, CMake and the Microsof's visual C++ compiler to build.

          <h3>Linux</h3>
          <p>
            As with windows, there is no distribution option via package managers or similar, but you can
            buid from source, following the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/rationalis-petra/hydra">github page</a>.
            You'll need CMake to build it.

          <h3>OSX</h3>
          <p>
            Hydra has not formally been compiled/tested on OSX, but if you are
            familiar with C++ compilation on OSX, you might wish to try
            adapting the build instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/rationalis-petra/hydra">github page</a>.
